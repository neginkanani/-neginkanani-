Here is a website that has an interactive dashboard to explore belly botton biodiversity dateset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Here I used the D3 library to read samples.json database from :
 https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

Then bar charts and bubble chart are then created as the user pick a certain id.
